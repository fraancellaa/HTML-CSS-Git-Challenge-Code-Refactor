# Updates
1. Header was not in-line. Organized how elements were set up and fixed overall header.
2. Button for "Search Engine Optimization" was not taking users to that specific part of the website. HTML file had only a div class instead of a div id AND a class, so it could link to the CSS modification. (links function correctly)
3. Limited repeated codes and organized those in one single bracket.
4. CSS & HTML file are commented.

# Updates
1. Header was not in-line. Had to organize the way elements were set up and just fix overall header.
2. The button for "Search Engine Optimization" was not taking users to that part of the website. HTML file had only a div class instead of a div id AND a class, so it could link to the CSS modification.

1. UM CANVAS - MODULE 1
2. Google
3. Peer Review
